Okay, so when you use this service, we need you to say itâ€™s okay for us to do a few things. Hereâ€™s what it means:

1. We need to remember some things about you so we can help you.  
2. We might tell other friends (who help us make this better) what you like.  
3. We have some rules to keep everything safe and fun.  
4. We might record your voice so we can understand you better.  

If itâ€™s okay with you, just say, "I consent," and we can keep playing! Thank you! ðŸŽ‰
